# HackMIT-EstarGuars

## Project Description
Estar Guars is a game I and 3 other parters developed during HackMIT 2018. We used Unity and the HTC Vive to make this project possible. We spend 24 hrs developing an asteroid game that puts you in the position of a spaceship navigating an asteroid field allowing you to navigate the field and shoot asteroids.
