# HackMIT-EstarGuars

## Project Description
Estar Guars is a game I and 3 other parters developed during HackMIT 2018. We used Unity and the HTC Vive to make this project possible. We spend 24 hrs developing an asteroid game that puts you in the position of a spaceship navigating an asteroid field allowing you to navigate the field and shoot asteroids.


## Function
This project is accompanied with a mobile app. The mobile app uses Googles Speech to Text API to turn your voice commands into 4 categories: forward, backwards, left and right. These messages are posted to our server. The unit then grabs the commands  from our ser ver and performs them one after another.

## Video

This [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=MmMTY_Vamag) shows how a user can give a set of commands and our unit will wirelessly perform the commands.
